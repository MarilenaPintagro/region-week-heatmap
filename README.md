# region-week-heatmap
D3.js heatmap showing a KPI progress in time for each italian region.

This code was originally found on http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084 for a day/hour heatmap and then edited for my own purposes of building a region/week heatmap. Currently it shows data for italian regions over the last 21 fiscal weeks.

Feel free to suggest improvements!
